Just a basic project on creating a english thesaurus,
currently it only searchs a word in whatever
case structure that the word might have in the dataset.
Once it finds the meaning or if there is nothing matching
it will either print out a message saying nothing found or
each meaning of the word with a 80-char line wrapping and 
numberd output for each different meaning.
